    "Explanation":"The map focuses on Australia, but the table does not specify the range for Long-tongued Nectar Bat or Long-tongued Fruit Bat. Combined with the known fact about bat species' specific habitats, it's unlikely these tropical species (absence of images implies less data confirmation or relatedness) are found widely in Australia, hence 'Neither' is likely correct unless further specific range information is provided.",

    "Question":"Comparing the highest crude birth rate in the 1880s (1885) with the live births in January to June 2023, approximately what percentage of the 1885 crude birth rate does the 2023 live birth figure represent, if we assume an average population of 25 million in 2023?",
    "A":"0.58%",
    "B":"0.64%",
    "C":"0.68%",
    "D":"0.74%",
    "Answer":"A",
    "Explanation":"Crude birth rate is the number of live births per 1,000 population. In 1885, the highest crude birth rate was 35.7. Assuming a population of 25 million in 2023, the number of births corresponding to a birth rate of 35.7 would be 892,500 (25,000,000 * (35.7 \/ 1000)). However, there were only 146,000 live births in the first half of 2023. Thus, this number is approximately (146,000 \/ 892,500) * 100 = 0.1636% or 0.58% of the 1885 figure, adjusting for the six-month period.",
